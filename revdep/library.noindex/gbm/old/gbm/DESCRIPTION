Description: An implementation of extensions to Freund and Schapire's AdaBoost 
  algorithm and Friedman's gradient boosting machine. Includes regression 
  methods for least squares, absolute loss, t-distribution loss, quantile 
  regression, logistic, multinomial logistic, Poisson, Cox proportional hazards 
  partial likelihood, AdaBoost exponential loss, Huberized hinge loss, and 
  Learning to Rank measures (LambdaMart). Originally developed by Greg Ridgeway.
